He is careful to emphasize that Nikkei is neither a showcase for Peru-vian cuisine with Japanese influence nor for Japanese cuisine that happens to use Peruvian ingredients. Rather, it’s a blending of two traditions into a style that is uniquely its own.</p>\n<p>“Of course there’s influence from Japan,” he adds. “But we also have Chinese-Peruvian cuisine called Chifa and Creole cuisine and Italian-Peruvian cuisine. Our food is a melting pot of many cultures – Peruvian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, African, Italian. Nearly every kitchen in Peru, from Lima to the Andes to the Amazon, has a bottle of soy sauce, and it isn’t imported from China or Japan – we have our own brands. We also have our own versions of pesto and minestrone. We take the best from other countries and make it ours in our own way.”</p>\n<p>A prime example of Peru’s culinary syncretism is ceviche, the Japanese-influenced national dish in which the raw fish was</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"columns","headline":null,"subheader":null,"icon":null},{"columnCopy":"<p>traditionally cured in lime juice for hours and, in early incarnations of Nikkei, flavored with a healthy dash of soy sauce. Today, ceviche further reflects the Japanese approach in its respect for pristine seafood: fish is cut, marinated, and served immediately. “Now we can appreciate the freshness of the fish along with the Peruvian flavors,” says Edwin Guzman Navarro, Aji’s chef de cuisine. “Japanese influence taught us how to use our own products in a better way.”</p>\n<p>Aji’s signature nigiri is another Nikkei dish close to the hearts of both Guzman and his mentor, Tsumura. The vinegared rice base is the very one used at Maido, Tsumura’s renowned Lima restaurant that currently ranks number ten on the list of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants and number one on the list of Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants. In fact, it’s the same recipe Tsumura learned while training at a sushi restaurant in Osaka. A slice of tuna, the fatty otoro, is carved with precision, pressed delicately onto the rice, topped with a sauce of sweet-and-sour mustard seed and torikara, and garnished with minced white onion.</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"columns","headline":null,"subheader":null,"icon":null}]},{"fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_Spacer","spacer":"small"},{"cutline":null,"fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_LargePhoto","floatingBodyText":"","floatingHeadline":null,"floatingTextPosition":"none","fullScreen":true,"image":{"altText":null,"sourceUrl":"http://ec2-3-21-169-223.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Photo-2.png"},"popup":{"fieldGroupName":"popup","headline":"King Crab Capchi with Nikkei Sour Pairing","popupCopy":"<p>“Everything I know related to Nikkei cuisine, I learned from Tsumura,” says Guzman. “Now I like to interpret my dishes with Nikkei components while also adding a part of myself.
