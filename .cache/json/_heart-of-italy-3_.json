It would rise in the oven, but when he took it out, it would collapse. And so he tried again and again, making the soufflé in many different ways until it was perfect.</p>\n<p>“Every night he would prepare something especially for me. My job was to clean, to clean everywhere. Because the next morning the chefs would come and look in the kitchen, and if something was in a different spot they’d say ‘Ooooh, this is a disaster! Where is Alfonso?!’ If something was amiss they knew exactly why – Alfonso had been in the kitchen with me.</p>\n<p>“This was our life. Alfonso cooked and I tasted.

The nearest city is Sorrento, only six miles away, but even now, it takes at least thirty minutes to drive up steep and narrow roads that twist through small villages and lemon groves. When Chef Alfonso’s father was growing up, it was a journey made only by horse.</p>\n<p>In 1990, Chef Alfonso began a serious study of the history of world tourism. To deepen his understanding, he decided to take his wife and two sons on a real-life tour of the best hospitality the world had to offer. Using most of his savings and starting from Rome, he led them first on an exploration of Cairo and Marrakesh. They traveled west to The Savoy in London and the Waldorf Astoria in New York, through Los Angeles to The Peninsula in Hong Kong, and on to<br />\nThe Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, whose Hemingway Suite made<br />\na vivid impression. He also visited Hotel Lisboa in Macau, never guessing that seventeen years later, in 2007, he’d return to set up his own popular restaurant, now named Casa Don Alfonso, at the Grand Lisboa.</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"columns","headline":null,"subheader":null,"icon":null}]},{"cutline":null,"fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_LargePhoto","floatingBodyText":"<p>“This was our life.

But by the end of the journey, he was convinced that his mission was not to incorporate the flavors of the world into his Italian food; it was rather to do everything he could to promote the outstanding produce of his home in Campania at a time when much of Italy was enthralled with French culinary approaches and trying to fancify pasta with dollops of caviar and foie gras.</p>\n<p>Soon after their return, Chef Alfonso and Livia were given a villa to live in by their family, but rather than occupying the spacious house, they sold the property within two days and used the proceeds to buy seventeen acres of farmland on the side of a hill facing Capri. “People said Alfonso is crazy,” he recalls. “I’d invested all my money, but there was nothing here, no water, no electricity. And now people come from all over the world.”</p>\n<p>As we drive to the farm, Alfonso parks beside the road, shouting greetings of buonasera to his friends.

Vegetables include aubergines, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, fava beans, peppers, chilies, spinach, carrots, wild herbs, tomatoes (cherry and San Marzano), capers, oregano, and artichokes.</p>\n<p>According to Livia, when they first bought the property, the earth was sick. Pesticides had killed everything and the tomatoes tasted synthetic and fake. To heal the land, they bought fifteen cows and used organic fertilizer to rebuild the soil. “We knew nothing, but we had passion,” she says. “We called professors from the university of agriculture and they helped us to work the land in the right way. It was hard, very hard. But we worked night and day to fulfill our mission.”</p>\n<p>Not everyone shared their vision for the farm and the restaurant. “My father,” says Livia, “was so disappointed when we started this adventure. He thought I’d become poor and that I’d sold the villa and renounced the family hotel business for nothing. Later they understood, and my father was so proud. He’d say, ‘Livia, I always knew you were clever – you’re just like your dad.’ Everywhere he went, he’d tell people he was Livia’s father, because by then the world came to Don Alfonso, and the world invited us to come and cook for them in their royal palaces. In 1983 we began to devote ourselves entirely to the restaurant. In 1985 we earned our first Michelin star, in 1993 the second, and in 1997 our third.”</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"columns","headline":null,"subheader":null,"icon":null},{"columnCopy":"<p>The couple’s younger son, Mario, leads the front of the house, where he not only charms new guests and gives them the unforgettable Don Alfonso experience but also remembers a lot of old names. “Half of the dining room each night is repeat guests, and after a while they become more than customers, they become friends.” And a number of Mario’s friends can become quite persuasive when they need a table. “Some of our guests call me from their yachts. They have my mobile number and they don’t ask me if I have a table – they tell me they’re coming tonight with a group of ten.”</p>\n<p>The restaurant, with just one seating a night, doesn’t believe in turning its tables. Guests are encouraged to savor the experience and stay as late into the night as they like. A full house is sixty, but that can be stretched up to ninety for special circumstances, with the courtyard, terrace, and even the cooking school and library able to accommodate guests.</p>\n<p>For thirteen years, Mario developed a successful career in hotels and hospitality across Europe. When he and his brother were ready to come home and rejoin the family business, his mom recalls reminding them of what they were getting into: “With Don Alfonso there is one way, only Don Alfonso. There’s nothing more – no Saturday, no Sunday, no Christmas, no Easter, there’s only Don Alfonso. If you love, you stay, if you don’t like, go now, not tomorrow – tomorrow is too late.” And Mario remembers replying, “Mom, why do you speak in this way? We know, we know what you do. We wish to stay here and continue your adventure.”</p>\n<p>Since then, says Livia, the brothers have worked relentlessly: “They never ask to go and dance on Saturday night, and this is nice, because they work with passion.

He has made essential revamps, including overhauling the booking system, without forgetting the foundational principles of hospitality. “When we hire new staff, we look for the heart and the soul,” he says. “Everything else you can train. When you come into a restaurant, there’s a rational part that’s studying the menu, checking if the glasses are clean, etc. We give huge attention to every single one of these details, and I have an operations manual – the rules – that staff need to memorize before they start work – where to put the fork, the knife, the tablecloth, what to do when the guest arrives.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s the second part, which is the feeling and which isn’t rational, and I believe it’s a question of energy. If I hire staff with dead energy, a negative energy, the guests will never come back. The service can be perfect, but they won’t feel happy. And so in our restaurant there’s always an energy exchange, and for me this has become a key mission and the most important thing to find in our staff – this energy. You can see it in their eyes, the eyes are a window to everything.</p>\n<p>“I’m giving a huge portion of my life to help them become men but also to train them to become sharks.

For me, the guest is king, and they are the ultimate judges who tell us whether we’re doing well or not. Every single act that we do for our guests is to make them happy.”</p>\n<p>Creating that much happiness requires a serious commitment. Ernesto, Mario’s older brother, not only oversees the kitchen with Chef Alfonso but also manages the finances and business side of the restaurant. “In theory, we get one day off a week during the summer,” he says, “but in reality, when we really get busy, we sometimes work for a month straight. I was lucky to start in the kitchen when I was still young. It’s like learning a new sport – when you’re young, every thing comes naturally, but if you start when you’re thirty, it’s hard.”</p>\n<p>Ernesto combines a chef’s passion for the kitchen with an analytical side (he graduated from university with a score of 109 out of 110) that has allowed him to help the family make bold and transformative investments in their collective future. In 2007, he persuaded them to make an eight-million-euro investment in creating hotel operations, building an underground car park, and more than doubling their footprint, all of which has helped them to continue attracting an increasingly upscale clientele. Taking their cumulative expertise to the world, the family has opened a total of eight restaurants in places as far afield as Toronto, Canada, and Helena Bay Lodge in New Zealand.</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"columns","headline":null,"subheader":null,"icon":null}]},{"cutlineOne":"lorem ipsum dolor description of the photo.","cutlineTwo":"lorem ipsum dolor description of the photo.","fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_ImageLayouts","split":null,"imageTwo":{"altText":null,"sourceUrl":"http://ec2-3-21-169-223.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/500x600.png"},"imageOne":{"altText":null,"sourceUrl":"http://ec2-3-21-169-223.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/900x600.png"}},{"cutline":null,"fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_LargePhoto","floatingBodyText":"<p>Spaghetti with mackerel in Carpione style, breadcrumbs, pine nuts and candied onions, on an emulsion of turnips and Alalunga tuna.</p>\n","floatingHeadline":null,"floatingTextPosition":"top right","fullScreen":true,"image":{"altText":null,"sourceUrl":"http://ec2-3-21-169-223.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/600x900.png"},"popup":{"fieldGroupName":"popup","headline":null,"popupCopy":""}},{"fieldGroupName":"post_Components_Contents_Quote","quote":"<p>“And from that we began to understand that we had a mission – to bring our story, our culture, our heritage onto the world stage.
